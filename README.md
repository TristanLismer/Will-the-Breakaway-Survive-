# Will the Breakaway Survive?
A breakaway is a small group of cyclists who race in front of the peloton in hopes of reaching the finish line before them. Due to smaller numbers, each rider in the breakaway has to work extremely harder to make this happen. 44% of stages are won by a rider in the breakaway. This project uses ML to determine whether a rider in the break will win. 

In grand tours (Giro, Tour, Vuelta), breakaways happen mostly on mountain stages (61%) but they can also happen on hilly stages (44%), and occasionally flat stages (4%). This data was provided by https://cyclingbeginner.com/success-rate-of-cycling-breakaway-comprehensive-analysis/.

The goal of this project is to take a race happening live, and automatically update the likelihood of the breakaway holding until the end of the race. I believe that I can train the data on not only the rider's previous history but also on specific elevation profiles, temperatures, wind, location, etc...

For me, this will teach me about ML principles and how to apply them to a topic I am passionate about. 

I guess the first step would be to find a treasure trove of data.
