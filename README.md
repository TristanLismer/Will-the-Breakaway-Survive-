# Will-the-Breakaway-Survive-
A breakaway is a small group of cyclists who race in front of the peloton in hopes of reaching the finish line before them. Due to smaller numbers, each rider in the breakaway has to work extremely harder to make this happen. 44% of stages are won by a rider in the breakaway. This project uses ML to determine whether a rider in the break will win.
